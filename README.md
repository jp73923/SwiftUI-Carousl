A carousel, also known as a carousel slider or image slider, is a user interface element that allows you to display a series of images or content in a rotating or sliding manner. It is commonly used in websites and applications to showcase multiple items or highlight specific content.

The carousel typically presents a set of items horizontally or vertically, with one item visible at a time. Users can navigate through the carousel by manually swiping or clicking on navigation buttons. The carousel can automatically transition between items in a predefined interval, creating an animated and interactive display.

Carousels are often used in various contexts, such as product galleries, image sliders, news headlines, testimonials, or any situation where you want to present a series of content in an engaging and visually appealing way.

In web development, carousels can be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks or libraries. In the context of mobile app development with SwiftUI or other frameworks, you can create carousel-like effects using scroll views, stack views, or dedicated third-party libraries.
